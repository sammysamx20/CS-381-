# CS-381-Haskell
This is a repository of my course work in CS 381. This is a functional programming class where we coded in Haskell and Prolog. We created programs that:
- 1. Define abstract syntax for a language that is given in concrete syntax.
- 2. Produce and explain a program’s output under static versus dynamic scoping mechanisms.
- 3. Produce and explain a program’s behavior under static versus dynamic typing mechanisms.
- 4. Produce and explain a program’s output under a selection of parameter passing mechanisms, such as by-value, by-reference, by-constant, by-result, by-value-result, and by-name.
- 5. Produce and explain the contents of the run-time stack at any moment in a program’s execution.
- 6. Produce programs exhibiting parametric polymorphism and explain their practical applications.
- 7. Explain exception handling mechanisms and demonstrate their effects on the runtime stack.
- 8. Explain the essential differences between the imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic programming language paradigms.
- 9. Define the semantics of simple languages or for individual language constructs using denotational semantics, and given such definitions, predict specific program values or relationships between values using the definitions.
